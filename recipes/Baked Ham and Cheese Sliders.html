<p>Mini sandwich rolls (Hawaiian sweet rolls are a popular choice) are layered with ham and cheese before being coated with a mixture of butter, Dijon mustard, and dried minced onion.</p>

<p>The result is gooey, tangy, and wholly satisfying sliders that will appeal to every kind of eater. You can opt in or out of the poppy seeds, but they do add a great crunch to the soft, melty texture.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>¾ cup melted butter</li>
	<li>1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
	<li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
	<li>1 ½ tablespoons poppy seeds</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
	<li>24 mini sandwich rolls</li>
	<li>1 pound thinly sliced cooked deli ham</li>
	<li>1 pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
	<li>Mix butter, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds, and dried onion in a bowl.</li>
	<li>Separate the tops from the bottoms of the rolls; arrange the bottom pieces in a layer in the prepared baking dish. Layer about 1/2 of the ham onto the rolls; add a layer of Swiss cheese and top with remaining ham slices.</li>
	<li>Place the tops of the rolls onto the sandwiches. Pour mustard mixture evenly over the rolls</li>
	<li>Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are lightly browned and the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes. Slice into individual rolls through the ham and cheese layers to serve.</li>
